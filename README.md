What is Kona?
-------------

Kona is the open-source implementation of the K programming language. K is in the APL family of languages. If you are an expert programmer who doesn't know an APL but wants to learn one, then this is the place to start. The K language is ASCII-based so you don't need a special keyboard.

For many people, K is the preferred APL dialect. It tends to be popular with investment bankers, the performance obsessed, analysts with endless data, blas√© experts, and other smart people with not a lot of time. K is a vertical language, meaning, fewer machines and fewer keystrokes do the same job, at the expense of a higher clock rate. It is a demanding language.

K was originally designed by Arthur Whitney and [Kx Systems](http://kx.com/). Praise for K should be taken to refer to Kx's K. Kx sells a popular database called KDB+. People can and do create networked trading platforms in hours. If your business needs production K support, you can [evaluate KDB+ prior to purchasing from Kx](http://kx.com/software-download.php), or possibly speak with Kx consulting partner [First Derivatives](http://www.firstderivatives.com/).

Kx's KDB+ uses the Q language, and is built on top of K4. Kx used to sell a database called KDB, which used the KSQL language, and was built on top of K3, an earlier K. To the confusion of all, these terms are used interchangeably. Kx's K3 is basically no longer available. Kona is a reimplementation of that K. Kona targets K3 but includes features from K4 and elsewhere. Kona is unaffiliated with Kx.
